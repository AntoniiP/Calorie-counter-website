# Calorie and protein counter

The project consists on a website and an app in made with react-native in the `app/` directory.

## Introduction
This project is meant to be an easy way to set a daily calorie and protein intake goal. 
The main feature of this project is the future ability to browse different foods and items from fast food places, to remove the struggle of trying to find online the amount of protein and calories each item on the menu has.

Such things already exist, however, no apps that I've tried have an easy way of logging what you want. 

## Key features
- Comprehensive food database: Access a database of foods and items from various fast-food restaurants.
- Custom recipes: Unlike many other apps, our platform allows you to create and save your custom recipes, with your food items.

Built with React + Vite, jQuery and vanilla CSS
